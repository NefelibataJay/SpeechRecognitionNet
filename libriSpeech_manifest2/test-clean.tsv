test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0002.flac	by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light	1188
test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0003.flac	my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side	1188

test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0009.flac	now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly	1188
test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0010.flac	but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly	1188
test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0011.flac	they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper	1188

test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0014.flac	do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one	1188
test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0015.flac	the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground	1188
test-clean/1188/133604/1188-133604-0016.flac	this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures	1188

test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0023.flac	let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0024.flac	poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0025.flac	the departing ladies who had said they would stay didnt of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0026.flac	the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0027.flac	he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0028.flac	the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0029.flac	there were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0030.flac	i dont anticipate	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0031.flac	she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0032.flac	yes but thats just the beauty of her passion	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0033.flac	it was the beauty of it	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0034.flac	it sounded dull it sounded strange and all the more so because of his main condition which was	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0035.flac	she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded	121
test-clean/121/127105/121-127105-0036.flac	but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked	121
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0000.flac	how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0001.flac	god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0002.flac	yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0003.flac	the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0004.flac	this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0005.flac	hester could only account for the childs character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0006.flac	they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young childs disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0007.flac	hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0008.flac	mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0009.flac	as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0010.flac	it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0011.flac	beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0012.flac	brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0013.flac	pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0014.flac	pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance	1221
test-clean/1221/135766/1221-135766-0015.flac	if spoken to she would not speak again	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0000.flac	hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0001.flac	another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0002.flac	at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0003.flac	the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0004.flac	we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0005.flac	it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0006.flac	the mother herself as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form had carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0007.flac	but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0008.flac	come therefore and let us fling mud at them	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0009.flac	but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0010.flac	she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0011.flac	it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0012.flac	they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were lattice windows the wooden shutters to close over them at need	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0013.flac	lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governors bond servant a free born englishman but now a seven years slave	1221

test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0018.flac	little pearl who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armour as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate	1221

test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0020.flac	in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0021.flac	pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0022.flac	but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening	1221
test-clean/1221/135767/1221-135767-0023.flac	there were a few rose bushes however and a number of apple trees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mister blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that half mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull	1221

test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0005.flac	no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone	1284

test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0008.flac	all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket	1284
test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0009.flac	then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pipt	1284

test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0015.flac	we are traveling replied ojo and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves	1284
test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0016.flac	the woman seemed thoughtful	1284
test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0017.flac	at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate	1284
test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0018.flac	it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own	1284
test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0019.flac	you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mombi the witch who used to live in the country of the gillikins to the north of here	1284

test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0030.flac	when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are	1284
test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0031.flac	at the emerald city where our princess ozma lives green is the popular color	1284
test-clean/1284/1180/1284-1180-0032.flac	i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors	1284

test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0001.flac	margolotte had first made the girls form from the patchwork quilt and then she had dressed it with a patchwork skirt and an apron with pockets in it using the same gay material throughout	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0002.flac	the head of the patchwork girl was the most curious part of her	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0003.flac	the hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0004.flac	gold is the most common metal in the land of oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0005.flac	no i forgot all about the brains exclaimed the woman	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0006.flac	well that may be true agreed margolotte but on the contrary a servant with too much brains is sure to become independent and high and mighty and feel above her work	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0007.flac	she poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0008.flac	i think that will do she continued for the other qualities are not needed in a servant	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0009.flac	she ran to her husbands side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0010.flac	their contents had all boiled away leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0011.flac	very carefully the magician removed this powder placing it all together in a golden dish where he mixed it with a golden spoon	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0012.flac	no one saw him do this for all were looking at the powder of life but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing and came back to the cupboard	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0013.flac	ojo became a bit uneasy at this for he had already put quite a lot of the cleverness powder in the dish but he dared not interfere and so he comforted himself with the thought that one cannot have too much cleverness	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0014.flac	he selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0015.flac	most people talk too much so it is a relief to find one who talks too little	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0016.flac	i am not allowed to perform magic except for my own amusement he told his visitors as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0017.flac	the wizard of oz who used to be a humbug and knew no magic at all has been taking lessons of glinda and im told he is getting to be a pretty good wizard but he is merely the assistant of the great sorceress	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0018.flac	it truly is asserted the magician	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0019.flac	i now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0020.flac	dear me what a chatterbox youre getting to be unc remarked the magician who was pleased with the compliment	1284
test-clean/1284/1181/1284-1181-0021.flac	asked the voice in scornful accents	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0000.flac	the grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0001.flac	the edict of milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0002.flac	but this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of christianity	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0003.flac	constantine easily believed that the heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0004.flac	some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0005.flac	they asserted with confidence and almost with exultation that the apostolical succession was interrupted that all the bishops of europe and asia were infected by the contagion of guilt and schism and that the prerogatives of the catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the african believers who alone had preserved inviolate the integrity of their faith and discipline	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0006.flac	bishops virgins and even spotless infants were subjected to the disgrace of a public penance before they could be admitted to the communion of the donatists	1284
test-clean/1284/134647/1284-134647-0007.flac	proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire the donatists still maintained in some provinces particularly in numidia their superior numbers and four hundred bishops acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate	1284
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0000.flac	since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0001.flac	the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travelers resumed their journey	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0002.flac	after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0003.flac	he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0004.flac	distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingachgook were frequent and earnest	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0005.flac	yet here are we within a short range of the scaroons and not a sign of a trail have we crossed	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0006.flac	let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0007.flac	chingachgook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0008.flac	the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0009.flac	it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0010.flac	see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0011.flac	if a rock or a rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0012.flac	extinguished brands were lying around a spring the offals of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0013.flac	a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0014.flac	the examination however resulted in no discovery	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0015.flac	the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion	1320
test-clean/1320/122612/1320-122612-0016.flac	run back uncas and bring me the size of the singers foot	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0000.flac	notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0001.flac	in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0002.flac	in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaams ass to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bears singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0003.flac	there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0004.flac	the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0005.flac	the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0006.flac	can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0007.flac	come come returned hawkeye uncasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0008.flac	the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0009.flac	i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly hymn can you lead me to him	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0010.flac	the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0011.flac	the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0012.flac	four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but close observers of the manner of their captive	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0013.flac	delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0014.flac	they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0015.flac	but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0016.flac	the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0017.flac	then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0018.flac	it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purposed of cookery	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0019.flac	uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withes	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0020.flac	the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0021.flac	what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and this singer is as good as nothing	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0022.flac	the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstrip the deer	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0023.flac	uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0024.flac	but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his companion	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0025.flac	so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0026.flac	well what cant be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0027.flac	as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0028.flac	my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0029.flac	if you are not then knocked on the head your being a non composser will protect you and youll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0030.flac	so choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0031.flac	bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0032.flac	keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0033.flac	if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0034.flac	hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0035.flac	then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0036.flac	god bless you friend i do believe your scent is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0037.flac	the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the others features is he afraid	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0038.flac	will the hurons hear his groans	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0039.flac	the mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0040.flac	he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village	1320
test-clean/1320/122617/1320-122617-0041.flac	uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions	1320
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0000.flac	i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0001.flac	i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0002.flac	my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0003.flac	without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0004.flac	i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0005.flac	i was absent rather more than an hour	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0006.flac	the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant bannister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0007.flac	the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0008.flac	the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0009.flac	the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0010.flac	i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0011.flac	a broken tip of lead was lying there also	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0012.flac	not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0013.flac	above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0014.flac	to the best of my belief they were rolled up	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0015.flac	did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0016.flac	i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0017.flac	so it seems to me	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0018.flac	now mister soames at your disposal	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0019.flac	above were three students one on each story	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0020.flac	then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0021.flac	there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0022.flac	i am afraid there are no signs here said he	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0023.flac	one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0024.flac	you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0025.flac	the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0026.flac	as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered by the side door	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0027.flac	how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0028.flac	then he tossed it down and seized the next	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0029.flac	he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0030.flac	mister soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0031.flac	holmes held out a small chip with the letters n n and a space of clear wood after them you see	1580

test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0033.flac	i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0034.flac	as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0035.flac	holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor halloa whats this	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0036.flac	holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0037.flac	what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0038.flac	i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0039.flac	and they are all in for this examination yes	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0040.flac	one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0041.flac	let us hear the suspicions i will look after the proofs	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0042.flac	my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0043.flac	the top floor belongs to miles mc laren	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0044.flac	i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0045.flac	he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0046.flac	but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0047.flac	did you look at these papers on the table	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0048.flac	how came you to leave the key in the door	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0049.flac	anyone in the room could get out yes sir	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0050.flac	i really dont think he knew much about it mister holmes	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0051.flac	only for a minute or so	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0052.flac	oh i would not venture to say sir	1580
test-clean/1580/141083/1580-141083-0053.flac	you havent seen any of them no sir	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0000.flac	it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0001.flac	he was pacing swiftly up and down his room	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0002.flac	this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0003.flac	no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrists door	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0004.flac	of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0005.flac	that is very important said holmes	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0006.flac	you dont seem to realize the position	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0007.flac	to morrow is the examination	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0008.flac	i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0009.flac	it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0010.flac	i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good bye	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0011.flac	when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0012.flac	the foul mouthed fellow at the top	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0013.flac	he is the one with the worst record	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0014.flac	why bannister the servant whats his game in the matter	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0015.flac	he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0016.flac	my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0017.flac	no good my dear watson	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0018.flac	i think so you have formed a conclusion	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0019.flac	yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0020.flac	look at that he held out his hand	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0021.flac	on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0022.flac	and one more this morning	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0023.flac	in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0024.flac	he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0025.flac	you know him i think so	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0026.flac	if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0027.flac	no sir certainly not	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0028.flac	there was no man sir	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0029.flac	his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0030.flac	just close the door said holmes	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0031.flac	we want to know mister gilchrist how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0032.flac	for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0033.flac	come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0034.flac	well well dont trouble to answer listen and see that i do you no injustice	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0035.flac	he could examine the papers in his own office	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0036.flac	the indian i also thought nothing of	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0037.flac	when i approached your room i examined the window	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0038.flac	no one less than that would have a chance	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0039.flac	i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0040.flac	he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0041.flac	no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0042.flac	a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0043.flac	he put his shoes on the table	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0044.flac	gloves said the young man	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0045.flac	suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0046.flac	have i told the truth mister gilchrist	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0047.flac	i have a letter here mister soames which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0048.flac	it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0049.flac	it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know	1580
test-clean/1580/141084/1580-141084-0050.flac	if mister soames saw them the game was up	1580
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0000.flac	in the debate between the senior societies her defence of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0001.flac	the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0002.flac	john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0003.flac	better go he had counselled sententiously	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0004.flac	might learn something useful down there	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0005.flac	but john theres no society just elementary work	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0006.flac	been looking up tooms county	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0007.flac	find some cresswells there big plantations rated at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0008.flac	some others too big cotton county	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0009.flac	you ought to know john if i teach negroes ill scarcely see much of people in my own class	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0010.flac	at any rate i say go	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0011.flac	here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0012.flac	she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0013.flac	so for the hundredth time she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0014.flac	cotton she paused	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0015.flac	she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0016.flac	the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0017.flac	there might be a bit of poetry here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0018.flac	her regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0019.flac	cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0020.flac	miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remark seemed called for	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0021.flac	dont know well of all things inwardly commented miss taylor literally born in cotton and oh well as much as to ask whats the use she turned again to go	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0022.flac	i suppose though its too early for them then came the explosion	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0023.flac	goobers dont grow on the tops of vines but underground on the roots like yams is that so	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0024.flac	the golden fleece its the silver fleece he harkened	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0025.flac	some time youll tell me please wont you	1995
test-clean/1995/1826/1995-1826-0026.flac	now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0000.flac	the hon charles smith miss sarahs brother was walking swiftly uptown from mister easterlys wall street office and his face was pale	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0001.flac	at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0002.flac	why should he not be as other men	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0003.flac	she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0004.flac	as she awaited her guests she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and disquietude for her social functions were few tonight there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james creighton the rich english manufacturer and lady creighton mister and missus vanderpool mister harry cresswell and his sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guests that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0005.flac	missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0006.flac	she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0007.flac	but you believe in some education asked mary taylor	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0008.flac	i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0009.flac	but cresswell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0010.flac	the vanderpools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0011.flac	positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sisters eyes	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0012.flac	but were not er exactly welcomed	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0013.flac	mary taylor however related the tale of zora to missus greys private ear later	1995
test-clean/1995/1836/1995-1836-0014.flac	fortunately said mister vanderpool northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0000.flac	he knew the silver fleece his and zoras must be ruined	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0001.flac	it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built around it	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0002.flac	ah the swamp the cruel swamp	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0003.flac	the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0004.flac	he panted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0005.flac	she was so strange and human a creature	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0006.flac	the world was water veiled in mists	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0007.flac	then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steamed	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0008.flac	where was the use of imagining	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0009.flac	the lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago and now	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0010.flac	perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0011.flac	he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0012.flac	he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0013.flac	then he looked down the lagoon was dry	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0014.flac	he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0015.flac	the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to burst to bolls	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0016.flac	for one long moment he paused stupid agape with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against a tree	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0017.flac	he gazed about perplexed astonished	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0018.flac	here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0019.flac	he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost zora	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0020.flac	the years of the days of her dying were ten	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0021.flac	the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0022.flac	up in the sick room zora lay on the little white bed	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0023.flac	the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned	1995
test-clean/1995/1837/1995-1837-0024.flac	for a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree	1995

test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0000.flac	the paris plant like that at the crystal palace was a temporary exhibit	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0001.flac	the london plant was less temporary but not permanent supplying before it was torn out no fewer than three thousand lamps in hotels churches stores and dwellings in the vicinity of holborn viaduct	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0002.flac	there messrs johnson and hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art and secured much useful data for the work in new york of which the story has just been told	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0003.flac	the dynamo electric machine though small was robust for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged it continued in active use until eighteen ninety nine seventeen years	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0004.flac	owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0005.flac	why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0006.flac	there seems no good reason for believing that it will change	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0007.flac	broad as the prairies and free in thought as the winds that sweep them he is idiosyncratically opposed to loose and wasteful methods to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0008.flac	everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy the contraction of space the intensification of culture	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0009.flac	for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0010.flac	it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0011.flac	but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm house the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0012.flac	edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0013.flac	unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0014.flac	mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0015.flac	he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0016.flac	then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0017.flac	edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system throughout of the tree kind	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0018.flac	he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0019.flac	the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0020.flac	it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0021.flac	the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0022.flac	meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0023.flac	i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0024.flac	but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0025.flac	they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0026.flac	the arc lamp installed outside a customers premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0027.flac	edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0028.flac	there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0029.flac	hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0030.flac	the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0031.flac	associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0032.flac	the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0033.flac	in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0034.flac	the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0035.flac	in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0036.flac	the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0037.flac	he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0038.flac	he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0039.flac	the problem was solved	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0040.flac	we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part	2300
test-clean/2300/131720/2300-131720-0041.flac	we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid	2300
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0000.flac	here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since pollys first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0001.flac	every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0002.flac	then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0003.flac	somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer	237

test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0005.flac	oh shes always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0006.flac	at this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped phronsie	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0007.flac	but polly couldnt speak and if jasper hadnt caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0008.flac	asked phronsie with her little face close to pollys own	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0009.flac	now youll stay cried van say polly wont you	237

test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0021.flac	she asked impulsively i didnt believe you could persuade her father	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0022.flac	i didnt have any fears if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0023.flac	he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0024.flac	and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time	237
test-clean/237/126133/237-126133-0025.flac	at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0000.flac	it is sixteen years since john bergson died	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0001.flac	his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0002.flac	from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0003.flac	from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0004.flac	the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0005.flac	he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0006.flac	thats not much of a job for an athlete here ive been to town and back	237

test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0012.flac	i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0013.flac	indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0014.flac	they think youre proud because youve been away to school or something	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0015.flac	there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0016.flac	on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0017.flac	any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergson	237
test-clean/237/134493/237-134493-0018.flac	there is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0000.flac	frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0001.flac	marie sighed	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0002.flac	a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0003.flac	the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0004.flac	that invitation decided her	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0005.flac	oh but im glad to get this place mowed	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0006.flac	just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0007.flac	we never had so many of them in here before	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0008.flac	i suppose its the wet season will you have to cut them too	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0009.flac	i suppose thats the wet season too then	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0010.flac	its exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0011.flac	arent you splashed look at the spider webs all over the grass	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0012.flac	in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0013.flac	marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0014.flac	and emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0015.flac	that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0016.flac	i dont know all of them but i know lindens are	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0017.flac	if i feel that way i feel that way	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0018.flac	he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0019.flac	he dropped a handful into her lap	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0020.flac	yes dont you	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0021.flac	oh ever so much only he seems kind of staid and school teachery	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0022.flac	when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasnt a little in love with him	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0023.flac	it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0024.flac	i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0025.flac	oh emil	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0026.flac	surely you are not thinking of going off there	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0027.flac	maries face fell under his brooding gaze	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0028.flac	im sure alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0029.flac	i dont want to stand around and look on	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0030.flac	i want to be doing something on my own account	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0031.flac	sometimes i dont want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table cloth	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0032.flac	i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0033.flac	i wish you werent so restless and didnt get so worked up over things she said sadly	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0034.flac	thank you he returned shortly	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0035.flac	and you never used to be cross to me	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0036.flac	i cant play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly thats what you miss marie	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0037.flac	but emil if i understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things together any more	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0038.flac	and anyhow theres nothing to understand	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0039.flac	that wont last it will go away and things will be just as they used to	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0040.flac	i pray for you but thats not the same as if you prayed yourself	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0041.flac	i cant pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i wont pray not to have them not if im damned for it	237
test-clean/237/134500/237-134500-0042.flac	then all our good times are over	237
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0000.flac	saturday august fifteenth the sea unbroken all round no land in sight	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0001.flac	the horizon seems extremely distant	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0002.flac	all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0003.flac	you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0004.flac	one might be with less reason than now	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0005.flac	i am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the sea is so wide	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0006.flac	we are losing time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0007.flac	he called this sea a pond and our long voyage taking a little sail	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0008.flac	therefore dont talk to me about views and prospects	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0009.flac	i take this as my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0010.flac	sunday august sixteenth	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0011.flac	nothing new weather unchanged the wind freshens	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0012.flac	but there seemed no reason to fear	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0013.flac	the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0014.flac	truly this sea is of infinite width	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0015.flac	it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why not	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0016.flac	these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0017.flac	i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0018.flac	i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0019.flac	i suppose professor liedenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0020.flac	tuesday august eighteenth	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0021.flac	during his watch i slept	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0022.flac	two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0023.flac	the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0024.flac	theres a whale a whale cried the professor	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0025.flac	flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0026.flac	two monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0027.flac	i can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal and as large as a mans head	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0028.flac	its jaw is enormous and according to naturalists it is armed with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0029.flac	those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0030.flac	suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water	260
test-clean/260/123286/260-123286-0031.flac	as for the ichthyosaurus has he returned to his submarine cavern	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0000.flac	the roarings become lost in the distance	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0001.flac	the weather if we may use that term will change before long	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0002.flac	the atmosphere is charged with vapours pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0003.flac	the electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0004.flac	the air is heavy the sea is calm	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0005.flac	from time to time a fleecy tuft of mist with yet some gleaming light left upon it drops down upon the dense floor of grey and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0006.flac	the atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0007.flac	the wind never lulls but to acquire increased strength the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful windy gusts and rushing storms	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0008.flac	theres a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0009.flac	those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0010.flac	on the mast already i see the light play of a lambent saint elmos fire the outstretched sail catches not a breath of wind and hangs like a sheet of lead	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0011.flac	but if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0012.flac	that will be safest no no never	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0013.flac	the piled up vapours condense into water and the air put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists rouses itself into a whirlwind	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0014.flac	hans stirs not	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0015.flac	from the under surface of the clouds there are continual emissions of lurid light electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules the gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0016.flac	i refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0017.flac	is the atmospheric condition having once reached this density to become final	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0018.flac	the raft bears on still to the south east	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0019.flac	at noon the violence of the storm redoubles	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0020.flac	each of us is lashed to some part of the raft	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0021.flac	the waves rise above our heads	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0022.flac	they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0023.flac	he nods his consent	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0024.flac	the fireball half of it white half azure blue and the size of a ten inch shell moved slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0025.flac	here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine horrible	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0026.flac	we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0027.flac	a suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air it enters the throat it fills the lungs	260
test-clean/260/123288/260-123288-0028.flac	we suffer stifling pains	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0000.flac	and how odd the directions will look	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0001.flac	poor alice	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0002.flac	it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0003.flac	oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0004.flac	alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0005.flac	and yesterday things went on just as usual	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0006.flac	i wonder if ive been changed in the night	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0007.flac	i almost think i can remember feeling a little different	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0008.flac	ill try if i know all the things i used to know	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0009.flac	i shall never get to twenty at that rate	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0010.flac	how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0011.flac	no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0012.flac	itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0013.flac	i am so very tired of being all alone here	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0014.flac	and i declare its too bad that it is	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0015.flac	i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0016.flac	i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0017.flac	that will be a queer thing to be sure	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0018.flac	i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0019.flac	cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended	260
test-clean/260/123440/260-123440-0020.flac	we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not we indeed	260
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0000.flac	we want you to help us publish some leading work of luthers for the general american market will you do it	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0001.flac	the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0002.flac	let us begin with that his commentary on galatians	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0003.flac	the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0004.flac	it was written in latin	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0005.flac	the work had to be condensed	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0006.flac	a word should now be said about the origin of luthers commentary on galatians	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0007.flac	much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0008.flac	in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0009.flac	it presents like no other of luthers writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christs merits alone	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0010.flac	but the essence of luthers lectures is there	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0011.flac	the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke two	2830
test-clean/2830/3979/2830-3979-0012.flac	the word of our god shall stand forever	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0000.flac	in every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint paul	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0001.flac	they said to the galatians you have no right to think highly of paul	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0002.flac	he was the last to turn to christ	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0003.flac	paul came later and is beneath us	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0004.flac	indeed he persecuted the church of christ for a long time	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0005.flac	do you suppose that god for the sake of a few lutheran heretics would disown his entire church	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0006.flac	against these boasting false apostles paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0007.flac	as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0008.flac	paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0009.flac	paul an apostle not of men et cetera	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0010.flac	either he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0011.flac	paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0012.flac	the most they could claim is that they were sent by others	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0013.flac	he mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by god	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0014.flac	the call is not to be taken lightly	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0015.flac	for a person to possess knowledge is not enough	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0016.flac	it spoils ones best work	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0017.flac	when i was a young man i thought paul was making too much of his call	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0018.flac	i did not then realize the importance of the ministry	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0019.flac	i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0020.flac	this is no sinful pride it is holy pride	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0021.flac	and god the father who raised him from the dead	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0022.flac	the clause seems superfluous on first sight	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0023.flac	these perverters of the righteousness of christ resist the father and the son and the works of them both	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0024.flac	in this whole epistle paul treats of the resurrection of christ	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0025.flac	by his resurrection christ won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0026.flac	verse two	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0027.flac	and all the brethren which are with me	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0028.flac	this should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0029.flac	although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think write and teach as i do	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0030.flac	they do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate they go where the christians are	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0031.flac	why do they not invade the catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of god	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0032.flac	we look for that reward which eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0033.flac	not all the galatians had become perverted	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0034.flac	these means cannot be contaminated	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0035.flac	they remain divine regardless of mens opinion	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0036.flac	wherever the means of grace are found there is the holy church even though antichrist reigns there	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0037.flac	so much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the apostle verse three	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0038.flac	grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0039.flac	the terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0040.flac	the greeting of the apostle is refreshing	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0041.flac	grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0042.flac	the world brands this a pernicious doctrine	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0043.flac	experience proves this	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0044.flac	however the grace and peace of god will	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0045.flac	men should not speculate about the nature of god	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0046.flac	was it not enough to say from god the father	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0047.flac	to do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0048.flac	he came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then he died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0049.flac	embrace him and forget about the nature of god	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0050.flac	did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0051.flac	when you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0052.flac	we are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0053.flac	at the same time paul confirms our creed that christ is very god	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0054.flac	that christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0055.flac	to bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0056.flac	otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0057.flac	the arians took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0058.flac	mohammed also speaks highly of christ	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0059.flac	paul sticks to his theme	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0060.flac	he never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0061.flac	not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but himself what for	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0062.flac	not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0063.flac	underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0064.flac	how may we obtain remission of our sins	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0065.flac	paul answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0066.flac	since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0067.flac	this sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0068.flac	the greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0069.flac	the vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0070.flac	but we are careless we make light of sin	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0071.flac	we think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0072.flac	this passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0073.flac	this attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0074.flac	this attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0075.flac	but the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them	2830
test-clean/2830/3980/2830-3980-0076.flac	on the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair	2830
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0000.flac	he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0001.flac	the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0002.flac	in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0003.flac	they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0004.flac	there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0005.flac	in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0006.flac	the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0007.flac	but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0008.flac	we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0009.flac	the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0010.flac	but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0011.flac	with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0012.flac	many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0013.flac	it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0014.flac	the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0015.flac	the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0016.flac	but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0017.flac	nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0018.flac	but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0019.flac	he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0020.flac	and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0021.flac	there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in platos earlier writings	2961
test-clean/2961/960/2961-960-0022.flac	plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0000.flac	socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0001.flac	and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0002.flac	and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0003.flac	i will if timaeus approves i approve	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0004.flac	listen then socrates to a tale of solons who being the friend of dropidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0005.flac	some poems of solon were recited by the boys	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0006.flac	and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0007.flac	the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0008.flac	but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0009.flac	tell us said the other the whole story and where solon heard the story	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0010.flac	but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples	2961

test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0015.flac	many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0016.flac	i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0017.flac	observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of man	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0018.flac	the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0019.flac	for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0020.flac	this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0021.flac	but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory	2961
test-clean/2961/961/2961-961-0022.flac	then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke	2961
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0000.flac	but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0001.flac	the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0002.flac	such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0003.flac	with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0004.flac	in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0005.flac	under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0006.flac	drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0007.flac	it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0008.flac	the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0009.flac	with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0010.flac	the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on womens dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0011.flac	the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0012.flac	there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0013.flac	this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0014.flac	many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0015.flac	so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0016.flac	many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0017.flac	the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0018.flac	the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0019.flac	but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0020.flac	so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0021.flac	whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character	3570
test-clean/3570/5694/3570-5694-0022.flac	the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0000.flac	in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0001.flac	the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0002.flac	but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0003.flac	in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0004.flac	if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0005.flac	the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the households pecuniary decency	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0006.flac	very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0007.flac	there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0008.flac	the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0009.flac	each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0010.flac	the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0011.flac	it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0012.flac	it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0013.flac	consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0014.flac	among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute	3570
test-clean/3570/5695/3570-5695-0015.flac	the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0000.flac	under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0001.flac	but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0002.flac	other circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0003.flac	a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0004.flac	the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0005.flac	throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumers good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0006.flac	as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0007.flac	the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0008.flac	but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0009.flac	in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison	3570
test-clean/3570/5696/3570-5696-0010.flac	an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions	3570
test-clean/3575/170457/3575-170457-0000.flac	and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity	3575

test-clean/3575/170457/3575-170457-0002.flac	why are we to be divided	3575
test-clean/3575/170457/3575-170457-0003.flac	surely it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the creator in idolatry of the creature	3575

test-clean/3575/170457/3575-170457-0006.flac	her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle	3575

test-clean/3575/170457/3575-170457-0008.flac	and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergymans daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured	3575

test-clean/3575/170457/3575-170457-0012.flac	you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her	3575
test-clean/3575/170457/3575-170457-0013.flac	the more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation	3575

test-clean/4077/13751/4077-13751-0008.flac	it is notable that the indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the latter day saints with favor seeing in the book of mormon striking agreement with their own traditions	4077
test-clean/4077/13751/4077-13751-0009.flac	the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of kirtland ohio almost within sight of lake erie and here soon rose the first temple of modern times	4077

test-clean/4077/13754/4077-13754-0002.flac	it was through floyds advice that buchanan ordered the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists	4077

test-clean/4077/13754/4077-13754-0009.flac	at the inception of plural marriage among the latter day saints there was no law national or state against its practise	4077

test-clean/4077/13754/4077-13754-0012.flac	this meant that for an alleged misdemeanor for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be imprisoned for life aye for many terms of a mans natural life did the courts power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be fined millions of dollars	4077
test-clean/4077/13754/4077-13754-0013.flac	before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there meet with the reversal and rebuke it deserved men were imprisoned under sentences of many years duration	4077
test-clean/4077/13754/4077-13754-0014.flac	the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure	4077
test-clean/4077/13754/4077-13754-0015.flac	then the church was disincorporated and its property both real and personal confiscated and escheated to the government of the united states and although the personal property was soon restored real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property	4077

test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0000.flac	fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0001.flac	it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earths convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0002.flac	exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0003.flac	she is under sail but she is count timascheffs yacht he was right	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0004.flac	if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0005.flac	he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0006.flac	the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0007.flac	servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavoring to put in	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0008.flac	a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0009.flac	slightly changing her course she first struck her mainsail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and jib	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0010.flac	captain servadac hastened towards him	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0011.flac	i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0012.flac	never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and by	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0013.flac	nothing more than you know yourself	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0014.flac	are you certain that this is the mediterranean	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0015.flac	for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0016.flac	to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0017.flac	some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0018.flac	you will take me on board count will you not	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0019.flac	my yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0020.flac	the count shook his head	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0021.flac	before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the dobryna should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0022.flac	it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0023.flac	a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earths orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide	5105
test-clean/5105/28240/5105-28240-0024.flac	doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0000.flac	her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0001.flac	after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0002.flac	the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0003.flac	steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0004.flac	although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earths attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0005.flac	for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0006.flac	the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0007.flac	there is no fear of that sir	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0008.flac	the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0009.flac	and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0010.flac	ocean reigned supreme	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0011.flac	all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0012.flac	is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0013.flac	would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0014.flac	another circumstance was most remarkable	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0015.flac	to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0016.flac	you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0017.flac	after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0018.flac	its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type	5105
test-clean/5105/28241/5105-28241-0019.flac	nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment towards the north	5105
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0000.flac	at another time harald asked	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0001.flac	what is your country olaf have you always been a thrall the thralls eyes flashed	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0002.flac	two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0003.flac	the rest of you off a viking he had three ships	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0004.flac	these he gave to three of my brothers	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0005.flac	but i stayed that spring and built me a boat	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0006.flac	i made her for only twenty oars because i thought few men would follow me for i was young fifteen years old	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0007.flac	at the prow i carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0008.flac	i painted the eyes red for anger	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0009.flac	there stand so i said and glare and hiss at my foes	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0010.flac	in the stern i curved the tail up almost as high as the head	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0011.flac	there she sat on the rollers as fair a ship as i ever saw	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0012.flac	then i will get me a farm and will winter in that land now who will follow me	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0013.flac	he is but a boy the men said	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0014.flac	thirty men one after another raised their horns and said	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0015.flac	as our boat flashed down the rollers into the water i made this song and sang it	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0016.flac	so we harried the coast of norway	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0017.flac	we ate at many mens tables uninvited	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0018.flac	my dragons belly is never full and on board went the gold	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0019.flac	oh it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0020.flac	a house smells of smoke a ship smells of frolic	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0021.flac	up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0022.flac	what of the farm olaf not yet i answered viking is better for summer	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0023.flac	it was so dark that i could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0024.flac	i stood with my back to the wall for i wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0025.flac	come come i called when no one obeyed a fire	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0026.flac	my men laughed yes a stingy host	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0027.flac	he acts as though he had not expected us	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0028.flac	on a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0029.flac	bring in the table we are hungry	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0030.flac	the thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0031.flac	they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked at last the supper began	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0032.flac	the farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0033.flac	you would not eat with us you cannot say no to half of my ale i drink this to your health	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0034.flac	then i drank half of the hornful and sent the rest across the fire to the farmer he took it and smiled saying	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0035.flac	did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0036.flac	so i will give out this law that my men shall never leave you alone	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0037.flac	hakon there shall be your constant companion friend farmer	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0038.flac	he shall not leave you day or night whether you are working or playing or sleeping	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0039.flac	i named nine others and said	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0040.flac	and these shall follow your thralls in the same way	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0041.flac	so i set guards over every one in that house	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0042.flac	so no tales got out to the neighbors besides it was a lonely place and by good luck no one came that way	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0043.flac	their eyes danced big thorleif stood up and stretched himself	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0044.flac	i am stiff with long sitting he said i itch for a fight i turned to the farmer	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0045.flac	this is our last feast with you i said	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0046.flac	by the beard of odin i cried you have taken our joke like a man	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0047.flac	my men pounded the table with their fists	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0048.flac	by the hammer of thor shouted grim here is no stingy coward	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0049.flac	here friend take it and he thrust it into the farmers hand	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0050.flac	may you drink hearts ease from it for many years	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0051.flac	and with it i leave you a name sif the friendly i shall hope to drink with you sometime in valhalla	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0052.flac	here is a ring for sif the friendly and here is a bracelet a sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0053.flac	i took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0054.flac	that is the best way to decide for the spear will always point somewhere and one thing is as good as another	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0055.flac	that time it pointed us into your fathers ships	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0056.flac	here they said is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0057.flac	we sunk his ship and men but him we brought to you	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0058.flac	a robber viking said the king and scowled at me	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0059.flac	yes and with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me the king frowned more angrily	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0060.flac	take him out thorkel and let him taste your sword	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0061.flac	your mother the queen was standing by	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0062.flac	now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0063.flac	and would he not be a good gift for our baby	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0064.flac	your father thought a moment then looked at your mother and smiled	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0065.flac	soft heart he said gently to her then to thorkel well let him go thorkel	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0066.flac	then he turned to me again frowning	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0067.flac	but young sharp tongue now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of	5142
test-clean/5142/33396/5142-33396-0068.flac	so i lived and now am your tooth thrall well it is the luck of war	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0000.flac	it was one of the masterly and charming stories of dumas the elder	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0001.flac	in five minutes i was in a new world and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest french company	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0002.flac	the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0003.flac	ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0004.flac	she signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0005.flac	the door opened again while i was still studying the two brothers without i honestly confess being very favorably impressed by either of them	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0006.flac	a new member of the family circle who instantly attracted my attention entered the room	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0007.flac	a little cracked that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0008.flac	mister meadowcroft the elder having not spoken one word thus far himself introduced the newcomer to me with a side glance at his sons which had something like defiance in it a glance which as i was sorry to notice was returned with the defiance on their side by the two young men	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0009.flac	philip lefrank this is my overlooker mister jago said the old man formally presenting us	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0010.flac	he is not well he has come over the ocean for rest and change of scene	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0011.flac	mister jago is an american philip	5142

test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0013.flac	they pointedly drew back from john jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0014.flac	a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well set on her shoulders bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight little figure too slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english ears	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0015.flac	our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten the right impressions	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0016.flac	for once in a way i proved a true prophet	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0017.flac	the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between naomi and me	5142
test-clean/5142/36377/5142-36377-0018.flac	he looked up at naomi doubtingly from his plate and looked down again slowly with a frown	5142

test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0001.flac	and he added something still less complimentary	5683

test-clean/5683/32866/5683-32866-0021.flac	my bed was unexceptionably comfortable but in my then mood i could have wished it a great deal more modern	5683

test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0018.flac	it is an antipathy an antipathy i cannot get over dear dorcas you may think it a madness but dont blame me	5683
test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0019.flac	i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you	5683
test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0020.flac	and she threw her arms round her cousins neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears	5683
test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0021.flac	dorcas in her strange way was moved	5683
test-clean/5683/32879/5683-32879-0022.flac	i like you still rachel im sure ill always like you	5683

test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0000.flac	he began a confused complaint against the wizard who had vanished behind the curtain on the left	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0001.flac	give not so earnest a mind to these mummeries child	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0002.flac	a golden fortune and a happy life	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0003.flac	he was like unto my father in a way and yet was not my father	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0004.flac	also there was a stripling page who turned into a maid	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0005.flac	this was so sweet a lady sir and in some manner i do think she died	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0006.flac	but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0007.flac	sister nell do you hear these marvels	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0008.flac	take your place and let us see what the crystal can show to you	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0009.flac	like as not young master though i am an old man	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0010.flac	forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss but master will who peeped out first needed no more than one glance	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0011.flac	he gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the squire and mistress fitzooth to the rear of the tent	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0012.flac	cries of a nottingham a nottingham	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0013.flac	before them fled the stroller and his three sons capless and terrified	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0014.flac	what is the tumult and rioting cried out the squire authoritatively and he blew twice on a silver whistle which hung at his belt	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0015.flac	nay we refused their request most politely most noble said the little stroller	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0016.flac	and then they became vexed and would have snatched your purse from us	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0017.flac	i could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing his duty as one of cumberlands sons	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0018.flac	so i did push this fellow	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0019.flac	it is enough said george gamewell sharply and he turned upon the crowd	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0020.flac	shame on you citizens cried he i blush for my fellows of nottingham	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0021.flac	surely we can submit with good grace	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0022.flac	tis fine for you to talk old man answered the lean sullen apprentice	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0023.flac	but i wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0024.flac	spoke the squire losing all patience and it was to you that i gave another purse in consolation	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0025.flac	come to me men here here he raised his voice still louder	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0026.flac	the strollers took their part in it with hearty zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0027.flac	robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valiantly did these two comport themselves	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0028.flac	the head and chief of the riot the nottingham apprentice with clenched fists threatened montfichet	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0029.flac	the squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0030.flac	now be silent on your lives he began but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0031.flac	silence you knave cried montfichet	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0032.flac	he felt for and found the wizards black cloth the squire was quite out of breath	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0033.flac	thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0034.flac	a montfichet a montfichet gamewell to the rescue	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0035.flac	taking advantage of this the squires few men redoubled their efforts and encouraged by robins and the little strollers cries fought their way to him	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0036.flac	george montfichet will never forget this day	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0037.flac	what is your name lording asked the little stroller presently	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0038.flac	robin fitzooth	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0039.flac	and mine is will stuteley shall we be comrades	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0040.flac	right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0041.flac	i like you will you are the second will that i have met and liked within two days is there a sign in that	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0042.flac	montfichet called out for robin to give him an arm	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0043.flac	friends said montfichet faintly to the wrestlers bear us escort so far as the sheriffs house	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0044.flac	it will not be safe for you to stay here now	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0045.flac	pray follow us with mine and my lord sheriffs men	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0046.flac	nottingham castle was reached and admittance was demanded	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0047.flac	master monceux the sheriff of nottingham was mightily put about when told of the rioting	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0048.flac	and henry might return to england at any moment	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0049.flac	have your will child if the boy also wills it montfichet answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0050.flac	he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0051.flac	beg me a room of the sheriff child quickly	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0052.flac	but who is this fellow plucking at your sleeve	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0053.flac	he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0054.flac	mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the sheriffs daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of montfichet	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0055.flac	robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0056.flac	the wine did certainly bring back the color to the squires cheeks	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0057.flac	these escapades are not for old gamewell lad his day has come to twilight	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0058.flac	will you forgive me now	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0059.flac	it will be no disappointment to me	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0060.flac	no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0061.flac	you are a worthy leech will presently whispered robin the wine has worked a marvel	61
test-clean/61/70968/61-70968-0062.flac	ay and show you some pretty tricks	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0000.flac	young fitzooth had been commanded to his mothers chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0001.flac	there befell an anxious interview mistress fitzooth arguing for and against the squires project in a breath	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0002.flac	most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0003.flac	if for a whim you beggar yourself i cannot stay you	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0004.flac	but take it whilst i live and wear montfichets shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight for you will neer disgrace our scutcheon i warrant me	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0005.flac	the lad had checked him then	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0006.flac	never that sir he had said	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0007.flac	he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0008.flac	now to bed boy	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0009.flac	tis late and i go myself within a short space	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0010.flac	dismiss your squire robin and bid me good e e n	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0011.flac	as any in england i would say said gamewell proudly that is in his day	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0012.flac	yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0013.flac	there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gamewells chamber	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0014.flac	presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0015.flac	will cried he softly and stuteley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young masters chamber sprang up at once in answer	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0016.flac	we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0017.flac	rest and be still until i warn you	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0018.flac	the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0019.flac	at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0020.flac	will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0021.flac	they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0022.flac	robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0023.flac	be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0024.flac	they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that warrenton had fulfilled his mission	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0025.flac	they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0026.flac	fitzooths hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0027.flac	robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0028.flac	stuteley was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0029.flac	from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrentons	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0030.flac	save me masters but you startled me rarely	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0031.flac	cried he waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0032.flac	enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0033.flac	truly such a horse should be worth much in nottingham fair	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0034.flac	nay nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0035.flac	warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think geoffreys claims to the estate would be passed by	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0036.flac	robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0037.flac	his tones rang pleasantly on warrentons ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0038.flac	the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gamewell that this passage way led from the hut in the pleasance to sherwood and that geoffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0039.flac	he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands	61
test-clean/61/70970/61-70970-0040.flac	they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell	61
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0000.flac	out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0001.flac	the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0002.flac	he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0003.flac	but this was what the tree could not bear to hear	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0004.flac	in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0005.flac	oh that made him so angry	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0006.flac	to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0007.flac	in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0008.flac	this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognised and then they were laid in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0009.flac	have you not met them anywhere	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0010.flac	rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0011.flac	and then what happens then	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0012.flac	i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0013.flac	i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0014.flac	were i but already on the cart	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0015.flac	were i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0016.flac	yes then something better something still grander will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0017.flac	something better something still grander must follow but what	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0018.flac	rejoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0019.flac	rejoice in thy own fresh youth	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0020.flac	but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0021.flac	and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0022.flac	the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0023.flac	he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the birds	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0024.flac	the departure was not at all agreeable	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0025.flac	the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we dont want the others	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0026.flac	there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0027.flac	the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0028.flac	this evening they all said	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0029.flac	how it will shine this evening	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0030.flac	perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0031.flac	it blazed up famously help help	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0032.flac	cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0033.flac	a story	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0034.flac	a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0035.flac	but i shall tell only one story	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0036.flac	humpy dumpy fell downstairs and yet he married the princess	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0037.flac	thats the way of the world	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0038.flac	thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0039.flac	i wont tremble to morrow thought the fir tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0040.flac	and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0041.flac	in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0042.flac	but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0043.flac	whats the meaning of this thought the tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0044.flac	and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0045.flac	time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0046.flac	tis now winter out of doors thought the tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0047.flac	how kind man is after all	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0048.flac	if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0049.flac	squeak squeak	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0050.flac	they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0051.flac	i am by no means old said the fir tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0052.flac	theres many a one considerably older than i am	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0053.flac	they were so extremely curious	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0054.flac	i know no such place said the tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0055.flac	and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0056.flac	said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0057.flac	yes in reality those were happy times	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0058.flac	who is humpy dumpy asked the mice	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0059.flac	only that one answered the tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0060.flac	it is a very stupid story	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0061.flac	dont you know one about bacon and tallow candles cant you tell any larder stories	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0062.flac	no said the tree	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0063.flac	then good bye said the rats and they went home	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0064.flac	at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0065.flac	now that too is over	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0066.flac	why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0067.flac	the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0068.flac	but it was not the fir tree that they meant	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0069.flac	it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0070.flac	the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0071.flac	in the court yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0072.flac	and the gardeners boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0073.flac	the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it sighed so deeply	672
test-clean/672/122797/672-122797-0074.flac	however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end	672
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0000.flac	kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogerss visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0001.flac	it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in states prison as a consequence of his rash act	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0002.flac	i cant see it in that light said the old lawyer	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0003.flac	it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0004.flac	but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0005.flac	he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didnt stop to count the cost	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0006.flac	if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0007.flac	but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0008.flac	fairview was twelve miles away but by ten oclock they drew up at the county jail	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0009.flac	they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0010.flac	we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0011.flac	im running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0012.flac	oh say thats different observed markham altering his demeanor	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0013.flac	may we see gates at once asked kenneth	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0014.flac	they followed the jailer along a succession of passages	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0015.flac	sometimes im that yearning for a smoke im nearly crazy an i dunno which is worst dyin one way or another	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0016.flac	he unlocked the door and called heres visitors tom	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0017.flac	worse tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0018.flac	miss de graf said kenneth noticing the boys face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0019.flac	sorry we havent any reception room in the jail	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0020.flac	sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice theres a bench here	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0021.flac	a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0022.flac	we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0023.flac	i didnt stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and im glad i did	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0024.flac	old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0025.flac	then rogers wouldnt do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0026.flac	he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0027.flac	whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0028.flac	he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0029.flac	its a stock company and rich	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0030.flac	i was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0031.flac	as regards my robbing the company ill say that i saved them a heavy loss one day	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0032.flac	i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marshall never even thanked me	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0033.flac	it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0034.flac	im going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0035.flac	it wont be much but im grateful to find a friend	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0036.flac	they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0037.flac	ive seen lots of that kind in my day	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0038.flac	and it ruins a mans disposition	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0039.flac	he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0040.flac	some girl has been here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0041.flac	im not electioneering just now	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0042.flac	oh well sir what about him	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0043.flac	and he deserves a term in states prison	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0044.flac	it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0045.flac	ill pay all the costs besides	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0046.flac	youre foolish why should you do all this	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0047.flac	i have my own reasons mister marshall	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0048.flac	give me a check for a hundred and fifty and ill turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0049.flac	he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0050.flac	beth uneasy at his silence nudged him	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0051.flac	there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0052.flac	he might have had that forged check for the face of it if hed been sharp	6829
test-clean/6829/68769/6829-68769-0053.flac	and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0000.flac	so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forbess aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0001.flac	one of mister hopkinss first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0002.flac	the weak kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or another secured from the opposition	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0003.flac	the democratic committee figured out a way to do this	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0004.flac	under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0005.flac	the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0006.flac	and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0007.flac	the description she gave of the coming reception to the womans political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0008.flac	these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0009.flac	louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0010.flac	the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0011.flac	tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0012.flac	this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been invited guests	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0013.flac	the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted foreseeing great success for their fete	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0014.flac	we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0015.flac	wont you run into the house and see if martha cant spare one or two more maids	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0016.flac	she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was the mistress here and beth was her especial favorite	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0017.flac	the housekeeper led the way and beth followed	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0018.flac	for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0019.flac	she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plain black gown with white apron and cap	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0020.flac	then she gave a little laugh and replied no miss beth im elizabeth parsons	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0021.flac	but it cant be protested the girl	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0022.flac	i attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0023.flac	you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where is your home	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0024.flac	for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0025.flac	she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth im sorry said beth	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0026.flac	eliza parsons shook her head	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0027.flac	they they excite me in some way and i i cant bear them you must excuse me	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0028.flac	she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0029.flac	beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0030.flac	her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0031.flac	her eyes wandered to the maids hands	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0032.flac	however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0033.flac	she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0034.flac	i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0035.flac	will you leave me alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you	6829
test-clean/6829/68771/6829-68771-0036.flac	eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock	6829
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0000.flac	concord returned to its place amidst the tents	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0001.flac	the english forwarded to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0002.flac	congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0003.flac	from the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0004.flac	she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened before them	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0005.flac	the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0006.flac	this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0007.flac	you will be frank with me i always am	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0008.flac	can you imagine why buckingham has been so violent i suspect	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0009.flac	it is you who are mistaken raoul i have read his distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0010.flac	i can perceive love clearly enough	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0011.flac	i am convinced of what i say said the count	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0012.flac	it is annoyance then	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0013.flac	in those very terms i even added more	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0014.flac	but continued raoul not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0015.flac	thus it is that the honor of three is saved our countrys our masters and our own	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0016.flac	yes i need repose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you return to morrow i shall no longer be the same man	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0017.flac	but in this friendly pressure raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0018.flac	the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0019.flac	upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones	6930
test-clean/6930/75918/6930-75918-0020.flac	bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of manicamp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit	6930

test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0001.flac	they were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0002.flac	the poor little things cried cynthia think of them having been turned to the wall all these years	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0003.flac	now what was the sense of it two innocent babies like that	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0004.flac	but joyce had not been listening all at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0005.flac	the twin brother did something she didnt like and she turned his picture to the wall	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0006.flac	hers happened to be in the same frame too but she evidently didnt care about that	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0007.flac	now what have you to say cynthia sprague	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0008.flac	i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but its been of some use after all	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0009.flac	do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0010.flac	what in the world is that queried joyce	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0011.flac	they worry me terribly and besides id like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it good scheme cyn	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0012.flac	well come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0013.flac	it cant hurt anything im sure for we wont disturb things at all	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0014.flac	this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0015.flac	smuggling the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust pan to the outfit	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0016.flac	the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friskily as a young kitten much to cynthias delight when she caught sight of him	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0017.flac	oh let him come along she urged i do love to see him about that old house	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0018.flac	he makes it sort of cozier	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0019.flac	now lets dust the furniture and pictures	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0020.flac	yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0021.flac	surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0022.flac	then she suddenly remarked	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0023.flac	and my pocket money is getting low again and you havent any left as usual	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0024.flac	they say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0025.flac	why its goliath as usual they both cried peering in	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0026.flac	isnt he the greatest for getting into odd corners	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0027.flac	forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding an occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner	6930
test-clean/6930/76324/6930-76324-0028.flac	well im convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0000.flac	no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0001.flac	i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffar his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0002.flac	onward said a distant voice	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0003.flac	no sound broke the stillness of the night	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0004.flac	the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0005.flac	what was that	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0006.flac	what then a human hand large and shapely appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0007.flac	nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0008.flac	it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0009.flac	i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with a phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffar	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0010.flac	a sound of voices a flash of light	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0011.flac	a feeling of freedom and i was awake where	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0012.flac	said another voice which i recognized as voltaires kaffar	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0013.flac	i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0014.flac	in the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discoloured	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0015.flac	i do not know i am dazed bewildered	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0016.flac	but that is kaffars knife	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0017.flac	i know he had it this very evening	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0018.flac	i remember saying have we been together	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0019.flac	voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0020.flac	i say you do know what this means and you must tell us	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0021.flac	a terrible thought flashed into my mind	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0022.flac	i had again been acting under the influence of this mans power	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0023.flac	perchance too kaffars death might serve him in good stead	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0024.flac	my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0025.flac	my position was too terrible	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0026.flac	my overwrought nerves yielded at last	6930
test-clean/6930/81414/6930-81414-0027.flac	for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly	6930
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0000.flac	the three modes of management	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0001.flac	to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0002.flac	by reason and affection	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0003.flac	as the chaise drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humor surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps an irreparable injury	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0004.flac	the mother as soon as the chaise is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction upon her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0005.flac	so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly wont you	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0006.flac	the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0007.flac	if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0008.flac	but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble	7021
test-clean/7021/79730/7021-79730-0009.flac	it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0000.flac	to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0001.flac	della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0002.flac	now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0003.flac	to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0004.flac	you have come andella andella was the name of janes doll to make rosalie a visit	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0005.flac	i am very glad	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0006.flac	i expect you have been a very good girl andella since you were here last	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0007.flac	then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0008.flac	for instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0009.flac	they were now playing with their dolls in the parlor	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0010.flac	delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave andella and rosalie here and dont say a word to them	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0011.flac	so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza there	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0012.flac	said she pointing to the playthings see	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0013.flac	put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out	7021
test-clean/7021/79740/7021-79740-0014.flac	and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been	7021
test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0000.flac	nature of the effect produced by early impressions	7021
test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0001.flac	that is comparatively nothing	7021
test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0002.flac	they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood	7021
test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0003.flac	vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing	7021
test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0004.flac	without going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresses upon the mind	7021
test-clean/7021/79759/7021-79759-0005.flac	the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0000.flac	but anders cared nothing about that	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0001.flac	he made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0002.flac	he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0003.flac	now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0004.flac	yes why not thought anders	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0005.flac	seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0006.flac	i am going to the court ball answered anders	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0007.flac	and she took anders hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0008.flac	for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0009.flac	at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0010.flac	on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0011.flac	the princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let anders sit in a golden chair by her side	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0012.flac	but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0013.flac	the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0014.flac	he only shook his head	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0015.flac	well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0016.flac	that is a very fine cap you have he said	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0017.flac	so it is said anders	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0018.flac	and it is made of mothers best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0019.flac	with one jump anders got out of his chair	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0020.flac	he darted like an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0021.flac	he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mothers cottage	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0022.flac	and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0023.flac	but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a kings golden crown he said that anders was a stupid	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0024.flac	anders face grew red	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0025.flac	but his mother hugged him close	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0026.flac	no my little son she said	7021
test-clean/7021/85628/7021-85628-0027.flac	if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap	7021
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0000.flac	at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five oclock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0001.flac	ah very well	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0002.flac	let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself au courant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0003.flac	gentlemen to your posts whereupon saint aignan and villeroy took their leave	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0004.flac	certainly sire but i must have money to do that what	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0005.flac	what do you mean inquired louis	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0006.flac	he has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0007.flac	it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0008.flac	does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0009.flac	not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0010.flac	your majestys plan then in this affair is	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0011.flac	you will take them from my private treasure	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0012.flac	the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry desire and wild ambition	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0013.flac	the king had completed his toilette by nine oclock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0014.flac	the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0015.flac	suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace and order spring accompanied by his whole court made his appearance	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0016.flac	the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadrille which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0017.flac	his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0018.flac	there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0019.flac	yes it is suppressed	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0020.flac	far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians have retained it	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0021.flac	yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0022.flac	sire he said your majestys most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0023.flac	the king seemed only pleased with every one present	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0024.flac	monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0025.flac	the ballet began the effect was more than beautiful	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0026.flac	when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theater shook with tumultuous applause	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0027.flac	disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgement he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0028.flac	by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied	7127
test-clean/7127/75946/7127-75946-0029.flac	the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0000.flac	every one could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0001.flac	upon this madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0002.flac	do you think so she replied with indifference	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0003.flac	yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0004.flac	explain yourself	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0005.flac	i allude to the goddess	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0006.flac	the princess inquired no	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0007.flac	she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0008.flac	the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0009.flac	a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0010.flac	when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0011.flac	remain i implore you the evening is most lovely	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0012.flac	indeed ah	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0013.flac	i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love any one	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0014.flac	forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned my brain	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0015.flac	there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0016.flac	oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0017.flac	what already here they said to her	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0018.flac	i have been here this quarter of an hour replied la valliere	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0019.flac	did not the dancing amuse you no	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0020.flac	no more than the dancing	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0021.flac	la valliere is quite a poetess said tonnay charente	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0022.flac	i am a woman and there are few like me whoever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well said montalais you do not finish	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0023.flac	it is too difficult replied mademoiselle de tonnay charente laughing loudly	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0024.flac	look yonder do you not see the moon slowly rising silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0025.flac	exquisite soft turf of the woods the happiness which your friendship confers upon me	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0026.flac	well said mademoiselle de tonnay charente i also think a good deal but i take care	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0027.flac	to say nothing said montalais so that when mademoiselle de tonnay charente thinks athenais is the only one who knows it	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0028.flac	quick quick then among the high reed grass said montalais stoop athenais you are so tall	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0029.flac	the young girls had indeed made themselves small indeed invisible	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0030.flac	she was here just now said the count	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0031.flac	you are positive then	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0032.flac	yes but perhaps i frightened her in what way	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0033.flac	how is it la valliere said mademoiselle de tonnay charente that the vicomte de bragelonne spoke of you as louise	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0034.flac	it seems the king will not consent to it	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0035.flac	good gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0036.flac	i give my consent	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0037.flac	oh i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the kings i suppose is it not louise	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0038.flac	let us run then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0039.flac	in fact the sound of madames and the queens carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mounted cavaliers	7127
test-clean/7127/75947/7127-75947-0040.flac	in this way the fete of the whole court was a fete also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the brake the pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening	7127
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0000.flac	all about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered in broad splashes	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0001.flac	the merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely pencilled in black and white and a breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0002.flac	his feet were red his long narrow beak with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0003.flac	but here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending claws	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0004.flac	but suddenly straight and swift as a diving cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0005.flac	once fairly a wing however he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0006.flac	it might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0007.flac	but such was his keenness that even while the wide flukes of his engorged victim were still sticking out at the corners of his beak his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0008.flac	in despair he hurled himself downward too soon	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0009.flac	the great hawk followed hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0010.flac	the cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0011.flac	in fact he had just finished it the last of the trouts tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0012.flac	the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0013.flac	like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0014.flac	the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0015.flac	almost instantly he was forced to the top	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0016.flac	straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0017.flac	but at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0018.flac	but this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0019.flac	as he flew his down reaching clutching talons were not half a yard above the fugitives head	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0020.flac	where the waves for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0021.flac	but as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam while doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0022.flac	the hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0023.flac	he had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0024.flac	the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawks angrily open beak hooking itself firmly	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0025.flac	at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0026.flac	the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling	7176
test-clean/7176/88083/7176-88083-0027.flac	then the leader parted from the line	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0000.flac	he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0001.flac	in short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0002.flac	but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0003.flac	your play must be not merely a good play but a successful one	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0004.flac	frankly i cannot always say	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0005.flac	but suppose you said im fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for punch	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0006.flac	ive got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps id better keep the plot a secret for the moment	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0007.flac	anyhow its jolly exciting and i can do the dialogue all right	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0008.flac	lend me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0009.flac	and i should begin with a short homily on soliloquy	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0010.flac	ham to be or not to be	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0011.flac	now the object of this soliloquy is plain	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0012.flac	indeed irresolution being the keynote of hamlets soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatists meaning	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0013.flac	we moderns however see the absurdity of it	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0014.flac	if it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage technique how shall a soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0015.flac	and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0016.flac	this would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0017.flac	in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0018.flac	in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do could anything be more natural	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0019.flac	i want double nine hal lo	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0020.flac	double nine two three elsinore double nine yes hallo is that you horatio hamlet speaking	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0021.flac	i say ive been wondering about this business	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0022.flac	to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows what no hamlet speaking	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0023.flac	you gave me double five i want double nine hallo is that you horatio hamlet speaking	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0024.flac	to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0025.flac	it is to let hamlet if that happen to be the name of your character enter with a small dog pet falcon mongoose tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part and confide in this animal such sorrows hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0026.flac	enter hamlet with his favourite boar hound	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0027.flac	lady larkspur starts suddenly and turns towards him	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0028.flac	larkspur bit me again this morning for the third time	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0029.flac	i want to get away from it all swoons	7176

test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0031.flac	and there you are you will of course appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0032.flac	how you may be wondering are you to begin your masterpiece	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0033.flac	relapses into silence for the rest of the evening	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0034.flac	the duchess of southbridge to lord reggie oh reggie what did you say	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0035.flac	then lord tuppeny well what about auction	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0036.flac	the crowd drifts off leaving the hero and heroine alone in the middle of the stage and then you can begin	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0037.flac	then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0038.flac	a stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors even when called charles hawtrey or owen nares are real people just like you and me	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0039.flac	tea please matthews butler impassively	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0040.flac	hostess replaces lump and inclines empty teapot over tray for a moment then hands him a cup painted brown inside thus deceiving the gentleman with the telescope in the upper circle	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0041.flac	re enter butler and three footmen who remove the tea things hostess to guest	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0042.flac	in novels the hero has often pushed his meals away untasted but no stage hero would do anything so unnatural as this	7176
test-clean/7176/92135/7176-92135-0043.flac	two bites are made and the bread is crumbled with an air of great eagerness indeed one feels that in real life the guest would clutch hold of the footman and say half a mo old chap i havent nearly finished but the actor is better schooled than this	7176

test-clean/8224/274384/8224-274384-0008.flac	the good natured audience in pity to fallen majesty showed for once greater deference to the king than to the minister and sung the psalm which the former had called for	8224

test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0001.flac	what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0002.flac	whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0003.flac	and what sort of evidence is logically possible	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0004.flac	there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0005.flac	all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0006.flac	the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has to trust his memory in making the record	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0007.flac	habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0008.flac	but i do not think such an inference is warranted	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0009.flac	our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0010.flac	we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friends face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0011.flac	some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0012.flac	familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0013.flac	in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0014.flac	i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0015.flac	they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0016.flac	in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0017.flac	there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0018.flac	there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0019.flac	it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0020.flac	if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0021.flac	remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0022.flac	some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0023.flac	in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0024.flac	the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0025.flac	we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0026.flac	this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0027.flac	a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0028.flac	i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0029.flac	the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0030.flac	semons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0031.flac	they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0032.flac	it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0033.flac	it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0034.flac	whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0035.flac	thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0036.flac	a further stage is recognition	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0037.flac	recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0038.flac	we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0039.flac	this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0040.flac	there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0041.flac	the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0042.flac	thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world	8230
test-clean/8230/279154/8230-279154-0043.flac	of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition	8230
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0000.flac	i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0001.flac	had eva crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mister bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0002.flac	on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0003.flac	as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0004.flac	i have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0005.flac	we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0006.flac	we are quite satisfied now captain battleax said my wife	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0007.flac	quite satisfied said eva	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0008.flac	the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0009.flac	no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0010.flac	their masters said missus neverbend	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0011.flac	i did not mean said captain battleax to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0012.flac	missus neverbend you must indeed be proud of your son	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0013.flac	jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0014.flac	sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0015.flac	i and my wife and son and the two craswellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0016.flac	this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0017.flac	my wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0018.flac	this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with her	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0019.flac	then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0020.flac	oh yes said jack and im nowhere	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0021.flac	but i mean to have my innings before long	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0022.flac	of what missus neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0023.flac	we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0024.flac	how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0025.flac	what could i do now but just lay myself down and die	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0026.flac	and the death of which i dreamt could not alas	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0027.flac	when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the farthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0028.flac	jack would become evas happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0029.flac	thinking of all this i went to sleep	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0030.flac	mister neverbend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0031.flac	you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stands so high	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0032.flac	it is a duty said i	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0033.flac	but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0034.flac	not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0035.flac	that is all quite true mister neverbend said sir ferdinando brown	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0036.flac	i can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter in which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0037.flac	you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0038.flac	therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0039.flac	i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0040.flac	then said sir ferdinando there is nothing for it but that he must take you with him	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0041.flac	there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0042.flac	you hear what sir ferdinando brown has said replied captain battleax	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0043.flac	but what is the delicate mission i asked	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0044.flac	i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0045.flac	then the republic of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0046.flac	you may be quite sure its there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0047.flac	you propose to kidnap me i said	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0048.flac	what would become of your gun were i to kidnap you	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0049.flac	lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0050.flac	one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0051.flac	what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0052.flac	you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0053.flac	were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0054.flac	the letter ran as follows	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0055.flac	sir i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britannula	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0056.flac	the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellencys knowledge	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0057.flac	but in their selection of a constitution the britannulists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberative assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0058.flac	it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0059.flac	but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your government	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0060.flac	the john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britannula should prevail	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0061.flac	you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north north west birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0062.flac	when do you intend that the john bright shall start	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0063.flac	to day i shouted	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0064.flac	and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0065.flac	i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinando	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0066.flac	they of course must all be altered	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0067.flac	or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0068.flac	your power is sufficient i said	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0069.flac	if you will give us your promise to meet captain battleax here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours	8455
test-clean/8455/210777/8455-210777-0070.flac	and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace	8455
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0000.flac	this was what did the mischief so far as the running away was concerned	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0001.flac	it is hardly necessary to say more of them here	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0002.flac	from the manner in which he expressed himself with regard to robert hollan no man in the whole range of his recollections will be longer remembered than he his enthralment while under hollan will hardly ever be forgotten	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0003.flac	of this party edward a boy of seventeen called forth much sympathy he too was claimed by hollan	8463

test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0006.flac	the doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down stairs as she was coming down	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0007.flac	another case said john wesley was a little girl half grown who was washing windows up stairs one day and unluckily fell asleep in the window and in this position was found by her mistress in a rage the mistress hit her a heavy slap knocked her out of the window and she fell to the pavement and died in a few hours from the effects thereof	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0008.flac	as usual nothing was done in the way of punishment	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0009.flac	i never knew of but one man who could ever please him	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0010.flac	he worked me very hard he wanted to be beating me all the time	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0011.flac	she was a large homely woman they were common white people with no reputation in the community	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0012.flac	substantially this was jacobs unvarnished description of his master and mistress	8463
test-clean/8463/287645/8463-287645-0013.flac	as to his age and also the name of his master jacobs statement varied somewhat from the advertisement	8463

test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0000.flac	its almost beyond conjecture	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0001.flac	this reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of twenty thousand leagues under the seas	8463

test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0003.flac	nemo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine the nautilus then conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0004.flac	in all the novel had a difficult gestation	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0005.flac	other subtleties occur inside each episode the textures sparkling with wit information and insight	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0006.flac	his specifications for an open sea submarine and a self contained diving suit were decades before their time yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0007.flac	even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn professor aronnax the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict conseil the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous tag lines for vernes fast facts the harpooner ned land a creature of constant appetites man as heroic animal	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0008.flac	but much of the novels brooding power comes from captain nemo	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0009.flac	this compulsion leads nemo into ugly contradictions hes a fighter for freedom yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good he works to save lives both human and animal yet he himself creates a holocaust he detests imperialism yet he lays personal claim to the south pole	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0010.flac	and in this last action he falls into the classic sin of pride	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0011.flac	hes swiftly punished	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0012.flac	the nautilus nearly perishes in the antarctic and nemo sinks into a growing depression	8463
test-clean/8463/294825/8463-294825-0013.flac	for many then this book has been a source of fascination surely one of the most influential novels ever written an inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer simon lake oceanographer william beebe polar traveler sir ernest shackleton	8463

test-clean/8463/294828/8463-294828-0036.flac	the wharves of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers	8463

test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0000.flac	then he rushed down stairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailorman was not recaptured	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0001.flac	hold him fast my men and as soon as ive had my coffee and oatmeal ill take him to the room of the great knife and patch him	8555

test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0004.flac	as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0005.flac	the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0006.flac	in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snubnosed princesses	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0007.flac	therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0008.flac	rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing	8555

test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0012.flac	the captain shook his head	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0013.flac	why you said to fetch the first living creature we met and that was this billygoat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goats horns	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0014.flac	the idea of patching capn bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0015.flac	they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and theyre nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs theyve both got the same style of whiskers and theyre both of em obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0016.flac	fine glorious	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0017.flac	when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0018.flac	at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0019.flac	before any could stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0020.flac	the goats warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0021.flac	then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices	8555
test-clean/8555/284447/8555-284447-0022.flac	i had a notion it was you mate as saved me from the knife	8555

test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0000.flac	so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told trot and capn bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0001.flac	then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0002.flac	at the head of the pinkies were ghip ghisizzle and button bright who had the parrot on his shoulder and they were supported by captain coralie and captain tintint and rosalie the witch	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0003.flac	when the blueskins saw ghip ghisizzle they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people	8555

test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0008.flac	then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0009.flac	you are mate replied the sailor	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0010.flac	it will be such a satisfaction	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0011.flac	the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0012.flac	ill gladly do that promised the new boolooroo and ill feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass	8555

test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0014.flac	the former boolooroo groaned	8555

test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0017.flac	when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0018.flac	so ghip ghisizzle ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home	8555
test-clean/8555/284449/8555-284449-0019.flac	that evening trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were invited	8555
